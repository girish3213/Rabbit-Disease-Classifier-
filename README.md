# Rabbit-Disease-Classifier

The ML model predicts a rabbit for a disease ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93526322/153710155-ba08f964-8aad-4ade-8ab7-f86f988d2c8d.png) or not based on thirty parameters of it. 
The ratio of the target variables is unequal. (0 : 1  = 0.998273 : 0.001727 ).
So, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) has been applied. SMOTE helps to increase the 'recall' of the model than doing the same without SMOTE.

# Target 
0--> Healthy Rabbit
1--> Unhealthy Rabbit
